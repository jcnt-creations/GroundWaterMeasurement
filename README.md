# GroundWaterMeasurement
A project for our c++ lecture at the AAU University Klagenfurt, to measure the ground water level.



In this project a water preassure sensor should measure the preasure in a well, and be read by a microcontroler. The microcontroller sends the measured data to a server which provides the data through a web server. 
The web server should provide the data, with some mean values, current value and other functions, over a REST API.

If the projects goes better than expected, the system will be extended with other sensors and functions.
